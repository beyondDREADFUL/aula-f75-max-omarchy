# Changelog

## 2026-10-21
- Wired controller, hooks, queue, locking, brightness preservation,
  verification, logging, state.
- Dongle support added: USB/descriptor detection, 32-byte output protocol,
  static-only colour, persisted brightness.
- udev rules and one-shot service installed with a dedicated `aula` group.
- First real wireless apply; colour came out blue, fixed by switching
  `wireless_color_order` from `bgr` to `rgb` (verified on hardware).

## 2026-10-22
- Added `apply --exact` (colour as written, no transform) after white showed as
  light gold through the saturation floor.
- Bar widget added and the project published as a repository with an
  installer.
- Protocol errors retried (3 attempts, 0.5 s apart). Added after a theme
  change was dropped on a missed ack (`no ack for 4/24`, 11:26).
- Wired `apply` optimised from 3.56 s to 0.68 s:
  - verify made opt-in (`--verify`);
  - direct frame written before `set_static`, using a cached full frame;
  - page-0 read replaces the full 9-page read for brightness inference;
  - pacing constants reduced (10/20/25 ms) and validated.
- All 34 installed themes pinned in `[theme_overrides]`, with six hand-tuned
  (`white`, `vantablack`, `fireside`, `solitude`, `gruvbox`, `rose-pine`) and
  the earlier `nord` / `catppuccin-latte` brand colours kept.
- Verified: brightness inference on the fast path, cache fallback, 20/20
  verified applies, visual theme switch to `kanagawa` and `white`.
